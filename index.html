  <p><p>
  Welcome to the Bird Identification, a simple Quiz—made for Pi Network bird lovers and curious newcomers alike.
  Drawing on trusted resources like
  <a href="https://ebird.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eBird</a>
  and
  <a href="https://www.audubon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Audubon</a>,
  this quiz invites you to explore the amazing diversity of birds around us.
</p>
<p>
  We publish fresh content <strong>every week</strong>: new regions to discover, spotlights on <strong>rare species</strong>,
  and features highlighting <strong>endangered birds</strong> and the threats they face. As you test your skills and learn new facts,
  you’ll also see practical ways to help—log your sightings on
  <a href="https://ebird.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eBird</a>,
  or connect with a local
  <a href="https://www.audubon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Audubon</a>
  chapter and conservation partners.
</p>
<p>
  This app is about action, not just answers. Together we can understand, appreciate, and protect our feathered friends—one question at a time.
  And with millions of birders worldwide, we’re bringing <strong>Pi cryptocurrency</strong> to the forefront of global conservation:
  <strong>Once a week, 50% of the Pi</strong> brought in through this app is donated to vetted, KYB'd nonprofit bird-conservation organizations that accept Pi,
  helping fund real projects in the places birds need most.
</p>
<p><em>Happy birding!</em></p>

<!-- Conservation & Pledge -->
<section id="conservation" class="card">
  <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
  <p>
    Bird populations are under pressure—habitat loss, collisions, invasive species,
    and climate change all play a role. Studies estimate North America alone has lost
    roughly <strong>3 billion</strong> birds since 1970. BirdID-Lite’s mission is to help people
    learn and care—and to support the groups doing the hard work on the ground.
  </p>
  <p class="pledge">
    <strong>Pledge:</strong> BirdID-Lite will donate <strong>50%</strong> of the Pi received through
    the app to a <strong>verified bird conservation nonprofit</strong> that
    <strong>accepts Pi</strong> and has completed <strong>KYB</strong> (Know Your Business) on the Pi
    platform.
